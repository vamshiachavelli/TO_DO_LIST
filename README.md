# To-Do List Web Application

Welcome to Day 5 of my 100-day journey of creating something new every day! Today, I have developed a To-Do List web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to add new tasks, delete tasks, and save unfinished tasks even after closing and reopening the browser tab.

## Project Overview

### Objective

Create a To-Do List application where users can add, delete, and persistently save tasks.

### Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Features

- **Add New Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your to-do list using the input field and add button.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list by clicking the delete button next to each task.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, ensuring that your tasks are retained even after the browser is closed and reopened.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures optimal usability across various devices and screen sizes.
